      <Bio>Born in 1469, he had a relatively normal childhood, growing up in a small farm town. He met the love of his life, whom he married at a young age. He was apprenticing as an alchemist when his wife fell ill from typhus and died a short while later. The loss sent him into a deep depression and he buried himself in his work and the field of disease treatment. He never fully recovered from his broken heart, and partly the reason he joined your expedition was to get over his grief. A somber and quiet man, but no man knows better the field of diseases and infections than he.</Bio>

He went from person to person and, with simple remedies, made almost every sick person better. His sympathetic nature is unmatched and he can make any person feel welcome in his company.</Bio>

He eventually tired of the stink and joined you, in hopes of fresh air and fresh enemies.</Bio>

With every passing evening, the rumours concerning "Maestro" Ortega grow ever more impressive.</Bio>

Though his father set him on the path of a military career, he chose to study strategy and battle tactics, and through hard work and stubbornness he earned a respectable place as a war advisor to a Marquis. But Reyes is in possession of an ever travelling mind, and when rumours from the New World reached his ears, speaking of dark cults and heathen rituals, he set his sights on those mysterious new shores. If there was ancient magic and forbidden knowledge there, it would be his.</Bio>

She collapsed and died close to the city gates, but luckily a young couple rescued Julio from his dying mother's womb and raised the child as their own. Because his adoptive father was the keeper of your father's library, Julio grew up surrounded by books and pamphlets alike. It was natural for him to turn to the sciences in that environment. Yet something stirred in him, driving him to seek adventure.</Bio>

      <Bio>Mercedes was born in 1496 to unknown parents. She was found on the steps at a convent where she was taken in and cared for. Growing up, she proved extremely difficult for the nuns, preferring to study fields that challenged their faith. In fear of being branded a witch, she ran away at age 13 and lived a secluded life up until joining your expedition. Her insights into mythology are unrivaled, and facing a world with a rich mythology in its own right, she is an invaluable asset.</Bio>

No books or scrolls are unavailable to him, as any who tries to keep them from him is dragged through defamation to the verge of bankruptcy. The means always justify the end for Carlos Zárraga, and the lore and secrets of the new world WILL be revealed to him, even if it means torturing every soul he finds.</Bio>

      <Bio>Beautiful Bonita was the daughter of a royal huntsman to the King. Her radiant charms and her incredible beauty made her the most attractive maiden in the court, to the extent that her father was forced to hire guards to keep the suitors away. What most women would kill to have was a curse to Bonita, however, as she longed to be respected and admired for her achievements rather than her looks. This desire finally drove her to run away and join your expedition.</Bio>

How he managed to escape the law for so long is unknown, but his continued freedom is a testament to his talents. He is ill-tempered and quick to anger, but in the jungles his patience knows no bounds. For hours on end he can be still, ready to pounce at the blink of an eye.</Bio>

      <Bio>Born in 1489, she grew up in the city under the roof of a fletcher. Her knowledge of bows rivals any expert, and her ability to handle them exceeds even that, but she's proven to be equally handy with an arquebus. She trained with the city guard for several years, before eventually surpassing her superiors, taking over their duties in teaching her fellow students. Although not exactly humble, she is still well aware of her limitations and has an overall pleasant personality, making her a great companion.</Bio>

At the last possible moment, Rafael was offered a chance of pardon if he agreed to be sent to the New World and serve the Spanish Crown on expeditions to the mainland.</Bio>

After she nearly died following a desperate makeshift abortion, her luck finally changed when she was taken in by a lonely old woodsman who taught her hunting and tanning. Her sense of self-worth finally restored after several years of maintaining a respectable living, she joined the crew of a ship to Hispaniola, where you met her as a hunter in the forests northeast of Santo Domingo.</Bio>

Her natural talent for path finding served her husband well, and for several years, business was good. When Daniela was in her mid-20s, tragedy struck as her husband was murdered by a business partner and robbed of all his possessions. Left a destitute widow, Daniela was found and taken in by a member of your hermandad, where she put her skills to good use.</Bio>

      <Bio>Fierce and independent Ana picked up the nickname "Pantera" among the troops early in the expedition. When on duty, she is remarkable for her ability to move unnoticed through any terrain, like a shadow that leaves no mark upon its surroundings. Needless to say, this makes her an excellent scout. Off duty, she is remarkable for having several lovers and not even attempting to conceal her conduct. Naturally, this gives rise to all sorts of gossipping, jealousy, and contempt among the troops, but Anita herself seems perfectly disinterested in all this.</Bio>

                                                  <Bio>The Hungarian mercenary is a powerfully built man who looks particularly imposing in his black piecemeal armour. He was trained in Hungary's Black Army and fought against the Turks as well as a peasant rebellion. After the dissolution of the Fekete sereg, his company struck out on their own and he travelled to Italy to fight as a mercenary. Now he has come to the New World searching for his old friend, Tamás Szász.</Bio>

He was drafted into the army and served uneasily under Capitán Noriega for two years. When he was fed up, he deserted and lived by himself in the jungle for almost a decade. Eventually he joined a band of fellow deserters under the secret command of Leandra Vizcaino, but he soon took charge of the troops, and they became far more loyal to him. Fearing a power-struggle, Leandra ambushed his troops, driving Esteban to seek an alliance with the savage Caribs. There, you found him again, defeated him one last time, and convinced him to join you.</Bio>

Isabela's mother was a Taíno woman, and as a child of two worlds, Isabela has never found it easy to fit in. Despite her difficulties in gaining the trust of her mother's tribesmen, and the often terrible treatment she sustained from the colonists in Santo Domingo, Isabela has stubbornly held on to a positive outlook on life. She is far from naive, having seen many of the worst sides of people, but she is a stoically polite and open-minded woman who fights for peace and reconciliation for both her peoples.</Bio>

Good luck, no matter what you decide to do in the future."</Text>
