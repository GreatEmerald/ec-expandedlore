  <descrExplorenearbycaverns>A cave entrance has been spotted nearby. Send an expedition member to search for metal ore. A higher Patrolling skill and your own Scouting will increase the potential boon of exploring caves. Beware that caves can be dangerous, and there’s a risk that the follower may sustain a light injury.</descrExplorenearbycaverns>
  <descrGofishing>The nearby waters are rich with fish. Send an expedition member to the coast, and they may bring back some extra meat for tomorrow. If successful, the amount of Meat gained will depend on the expedition member’s Hunting skill and your own Hunting.</descrGofishing>
  <descrHarvestmedicalherbs>The undergrowth is covered in herbs with medicinal applications. Send an expedition member to harvest them. The spoils of the foray depend on the follower’s Herbalism skill and your knowledge of Healing.</descrHarvestmedicalherbs>
  <descrRaidburialgrounds>Natives have been known to bury their dead nearby. Send an expedition member to search the graves for valuable trinkets. A higher Patrolling skill and your own Scouting will increase the potential loot from grave robbing. This is dirty work, however, and it may hurt the morale of the expedition member assigned.</descrRaidburialgrounds>
  <descrRepairCannon>Your cannon has been damaged in combat and cannot be used again until repaired. Assign an expedition member to restore the cannon to working order.</descrRepairCannon>
  <descrRepairbrokenequipment>You’ve broken enough equipment in battle that you could scavenge it for usable parts. Assign an expedition member to put together a few new pieces of equipment from the broken items.</descrRepairbrokenequipment>
  <descrArrangememorialservicefor>The death of an expedition member always hurts morale, no matter the circumstances. Dedicate one of your expedition members’ time to arranging a small memorial service, and some of the morale your surviving expedition members have lost will be restored.</descrArrangememorialservicefor>
  <descrConsolidateyourmapsofthe>Your expedition has finished charting a region of this strange new land. Assign an expedition member to consolidate the maps of this region and make the most use of your knowledge. This will double the experience you got from finding the related cairns.</descrConsolidateyourmapsofthe>

  <hintIllumined>If a unit is standing near torches or other fire during night or interior battles, it will be easier to hit.</hintIllumined>
  <hintHardTime>If you are having a hard time consider lowering the difficulty</hintHardTime>
  <hintRotate>You can rotate the camera with Q and E (by default) or by dragging with the right mouse button.</hintRotate>
  <hintFlank>Flank enemies to deal more damage.</hintFlank>
  <hintTacticalMove>Don’t forget that you can use Tactical Move to escape an enemy without provoking Attack of Opportunity.</hintTacticalMove>
  <hintPanCam>In combat, you can pan the camera with WASD (by default) or the cursor keys.</hintPanCam>
  <hintLOS>The colour of your line of sight indicator for ranged attacks shows how clear your shot is – green is a clear shot, yellow indicates partial cover, and red means you have no shot.</hintLOS>
  <hintEndurance>You can see every unit’s endurance bar if you hold down the Highlight hotkey (Alt by default).</hintEndurance>
  <hintUnusedMeat>Unused Meat spoils overnight. You can convert Meat to Rations each night by using the Preserve task during Camp Management.</hintUnusedMeat>
  <hintScout>The Scout is a high damage melee unit with great movement range, good for flanking and hit-and-run tactics.</hintScout>
  <hintSoldiers>Soldiers have high defence and good melee attacks and are great for protecting your more fragile units.</hintSoldiers>
  <hintHunters>Hunters are your best ranged units but very weak in melee combat.</hintHunters>
  <hintDoctor>Doctors are your basic healers, capable of restoring a measure of Endurance to other units during combat, or (on higher levels) curing negative effects and even reviving incapacitated allies.</hintDoctor>
  <hintScholar>The Scholar is a support unit who excels at making other units better and whose ranged attacks automatically lower an enemy’s Defence for all allies for the rest of the turn (regardless of whether or not it hits).</hintScholar>
  <hintPath>When you’ve set a path for your expedition to travel along, pressing Space starts or stops your movement along that path.</hintPath>
  <hintPreparation>When available, use the Preparation phase to select a good starting formation and to place traps and barricades.</hintPreparation>
  <hintWeapon>Don’t forget to switch to a melee weapon when an enemy is next to your unit – making a ranged attack when a unit is in melee range provokes an Attack of Opportunity.</hintWeapon>
  <hintSwitching>Switching between a unit’s ranged and melee weapons (R by default) is a free action that you can do whenever you wish.</hintSwitching>
  <hintCampManagement>Auto-assigning tasks on the Camp Management screen is a convenience that does not necessarily give you the optimal outcome. Remember to double-check your tasks after using it!</hintCampManagement>
  <hintContextual>Contextual events such as fishing are a great way to gain extra resources when you make camp.</hintContextual>
  <hintExploringTime>Remember to spend some time exploring the world for optional quests and events that can give you more resources and experience points.</hintExploringTime>
  <hintHighmorale>High morale not only prevents your units from leaving you in a mutiny, it also improves their critical hit chance in combat.</hintHighmorale>
  <hintMovingOnTheMap>You can set a path over a long distance by clicking on any icon on the world map. Then just press Space (by default) to get moving.</hintMovingOnTheMap>
  <hintAguirre>You’re playing on Insane difficulty. If you were expecting loading screen hints, sorry: You’re on your own.</hintAguirre>

  <explanatoryText>Welcome to Character Creation. This is where you choose what kind of Conquistador you wish to be. Your choices in this menu and the following will influence your opportunities and challenges throughout the game. But don't be alarmed! The decisions you make here may make the game harder, but they cannot make it impossible.

The current screen lets you set up your own character - gender, name, and skills. Your skills will influence your access to, and consumption of, resources such as medicine and rations, and skills will also open up new options during events and conversations.

You can always move your cursor over icons to see what they mean.

It is recommended that you choose two or three skills to specialise in, without lowering any of your skills completely - but feel free to follow your instincts if they tell you otherwise.

On the next screen, you will have to select the people to bring on your expedition to the New World. The different character types provide substantial bonuses to your skills, and different characters have different strengths, weaknesses, and abilities in a battle.

Each character also has three personality traits which determine what will cause them to lose or gain morale throughout your travels.</explanatoryText>

  <explanatoryTextBackground>The year is 1518 - a year before Hernán Cortes would be elected captain of the third expedition to the South American mainland, where he would overthrow the Aztec empire. But that will not happen, because you have beaten him to the punch.

You are the eldest child of a Spanish nobleman, and you yourself hold the title of Hidalgo. With your father's backing, you have been the leader of a successful "hermandad" (meaning "brotherhood") back in the Old World - a peacekeeping association of armed individuals which protected the countryside around your father's town.

During this time, you demonstrated an aptitude for leadership and strategy that earned you the respect of the people under your command - but it was time for a greater challenge. With the King's permission and your father's financial support, you purchased a ship and selected your crew from the best of the brothers and sisters in your hermandad.

Together, you are off on the long and arduous journey to explore the New World. In your cargo hold, you bring rations, medicine, equipment, and assorted valuables. You must first make a stop on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, under Spanish domain since 1496. Here, you will hire servants or buy slaves, rest and restock, and gain what information you can about the New World.

After five weeks on the Atlantic Ocean, your people gather on the deck as the call "Land ahoy!" rings out from the rigging. On a clear afternoon, gulls screeching in the wake of your ship, you sail into the port of Santo Domingo, the seat of Spanish colonial rule in the New World.</explanatoryTextBackground>
